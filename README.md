## About this project
This is a demo project with examples for higher order functions, extension functions
and function literals with receiver to build a DSL with Kotlin.

The code was part of the live demo of my `Kotlin: Fun with Functions` presentation at the
[Kotlin Karlsruhe User Group](https://www.meetup.com/de-DE/Kotlin-Karlsruhe-User-Group/events/247320883/).
